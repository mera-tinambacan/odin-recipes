            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <h4>Burger Patty</h4>
            
            <h5>Prepare the Mixture:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine breadcrumbs and milk.</li>
                <li>Let the mixture sit for 2-3 minutes until the breadcrumbs soften.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork for extra flavor).</li>
                <li>Season with salt, pepper, and a splash of liquid seasoning for depth.</li>
                <li>Toss in finely minced onion and crack in an egg. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>Shape the Patties:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Divide the meat mixture into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten it gently with your hands to form a patty.</li>
                <li>Place each patty on a sheet of wax paper to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Arrange them in a container and freeze for at least 30 minutes to firm up. (Thaw for 10-15 minutes before cooking if frozen.)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>Cook the Patties:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefolly add the patties.</li>
                <li>Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
                <li>Avoid overcrowding the pan to ensure even cooking.</li>
                <li>Remove the patties and set them aside on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Mushroom Gravy</h4>
            
            <h5>Sauté the Mushrooms:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>In the same pan, melt butter over low heat.</li>
                <li>Add sliced mushrooms and sauté for 1-2 minutes until they soften and release their aroma.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>Make the Roux:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms and stir continuously for 2 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>Create the Gravy:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Gradually pour in hot water while stirring constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
                <li>Add a beef cube, a dash of soy sauce, and a pinch of black pepper for seasoning.</li>
                <li>Let the gravy simmer for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens to your desired consistency.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>Combine and Serve:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the cooked burger patties on a plate, pour the hot mushroom gravy over them, and serve with steamed rice.</li>
            </ol>
